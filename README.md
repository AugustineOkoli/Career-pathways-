# Career-pathways
Career pathways for college graduates is crucial for informed decision-making. By analysing the relationship between majors and GPAs, this project aims to forecast career trajectories, providing valuable insights for students, educators, and employers. By leveraging data-driven approaches, this research seeks to illuminate the connections between academic performance, field of study, and professional outcomes, ultimately guiding graduates towards fulfilling career paths aligned with their strengths and interests. To achieve this, we employed several machine learning models: logistic regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Each model was trained on a dataset comprising graduates' academic majors, GPAs, and their career choices. We used advanced methods to clean and pre-process the data, ensuring it was suitable for training the models. After extensive training and evaluation, we found that the SVM model demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting career outcomes, outperforming the logistic regression and Random Forest models.
